good, and our people enjoyed a high standard of public

OVERVIEW

INTRODUCTION
The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) was
formed in Sep 72. It has, over the past 27 years,
successfully created a clean living environment and
a high standard of public health for Singaporeans.

ENV has established a comprehensive
sewerage system to collect and treat all wastewater.

The cleanliness of our inland and coastal waters is
a joy to our people, who are able to enjoy various
recreational water activities. An effective sewerage and
wastewater treatment system has helped
to keep our waters clean and safe.

QUALITY

In 1999, ENV approved 90 trade effluent treatment
facilities. A breakdown of the treatment facilities
approved is given in Table 1.

Control of Farm Wastes
Farm wastes comprise mainly animal wastes.
The major farm waste is poultry waste. Pollution
from poultry farms is controlled by requiring
poultry to be reared in covered sheds and the dung
removed in solid form. Most of the dung removed
is used as fertiliser. Wastes from the few cattle
farms in Lim Chu Kang are biologically treated
and the treated effluent is discharged into
